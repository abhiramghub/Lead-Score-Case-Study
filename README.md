# Lead-Score-Case-Study
## Objective
An Education company called X Education provides (sells) online courses to professionals in the field and to upcoming professionals. At any point in time, numerous professionals interested in their courses go on their website and look for courses.The company promotes its courses through a variety of websites as well as on search engines like Google. After they have landed on the site they may browse the course or fill out forms to enroll in the course or view some videos. If they fill out an application form with their email address and phone number, they're considered as a lead. In addition, the company receives leads from referrals made in the past. When leads are gathered then employees of the sales team begin making calls, sending emails, and so on. In this way, certain leads are converted, while many don't. The average lead conversion rate for X Education is about 40 percent. Although X Education gets a lot of leads, their lead conversion rates are extremely low. For instance, if suppose they get 100 leads over the course of a single day, just 30 of them convert. To make the method more productive, the organization seeks to determine the top possible leads, also referred to as Hot Leads. If they are able to find this group of leads, then the lead conversion rate will increase since the sales staff will be more focused on contacting potential leads, rather than calling everyone. Build an algorithm for logistic regression to give a lead score of 100 and 0 for every lead that can be utilized by the business to find leads for future campaigns. A higher score indicates that the lead has a high probability of conversion, i.e. is likely to convert, whereas a lower score indicates it is not hot and may most likely not be converted. These issues are available in a separate document. Please fill it in based on the model of logistic regression that you learned in the first step. Be sure to include this information in your final PPT in which you'll offer suggestions.
